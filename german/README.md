Snowball German
================

This package implements the German language
[Snowball stemmer](https://snowballstem.org/algorithms/german/stemmer.html).

## Implementation

The German language stemmer comprises preprocessing and 3 steps.
Each of these is defined in a separate file in this
package.  All of the steps operate on a `SnowballWord` from the
`snowballword` package and *modify the word in place*.

## Caveats

None
